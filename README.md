# Company_Management_Tools
Three fake management tools that I created to simulate the growth of a fake company. Created when I was 12 or 13.

Although not all of the features of the tools work, and they have no real life application, it aided me in my development as a programmer, but also serves as a testament to my entreupenerial interests from a very young age
